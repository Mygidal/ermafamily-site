        ABOUT US
      </h1>

      <p>
        <strong>ERMA – FAMILY Ltd.</strong> is more than a construction company. It is a <strong>belief in family, tradition, and honest labor</strong>, passed down through generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our story begins in <strong>1994</strong>, when <strong>Tsvetanka Stoilova Yoveva</strong>, inspired by her deep roots and the craftsmanship honor of her father – <strong>Stoil Trendafilov</strong>, founded “ERMA – Tsvetanka Stoilova” ET. Stoil Trendafilov is a respected name in the construction world – a builder by vocation, whose principles of precision, integrity, and respect for the craft laid the foundation of our family’s philosophy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The construction spirit in the family didn’t stop there. Tsvetanka’s husband – <strong>Georgi Yovev</strong>, also committed to the industry, founded <strong>“GECEBOMI” Ltd.</strong>, one of the leading construction companies in Eastern Bulgaria, ranking second in revenue after MADARA AD. This experience and success are part of our DNA.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, the family mission continues through <strong>Boyan Georgiev Yovev</strong> – son of Tsvetanka and Georgi, father of <strong>Edi</strong> and <strong>Monika</strong>, and founder of <strong>“HIKS 5 GROUP” Ltd.</strong> and later <strong>“H5M GROUP” Ltd.</strong> – investment and construction companies committed to sustainable development, innovation, and honoring their heritage.
      </p>

      <p>
        But our family is not just a company. It is <strong>the voice of the Tran region</strong> – a strong and proud land that has given Bulgaria <strong>some of the best formwork masters and builders</strong>. Over the years, these craftsmen, born in the mountains and raised through hard labor, built bridges, buildings, and inns with their own hands – not with drones or concrete robots, but with skill and honor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, such masters are becoming rare. The world is changing, but we do not forget.  
        <strong>ERMA – FAMILY Ltd.</strong> is fighting <strong>to preserve and pass on</strong> this golden knowledge.  
        To teach young builders. To bring pride back into craftsmanship. To build not only with bricks, but with memory.
      </p>

      <p className="text-center font-semibold text-blue-900">
        ERMA – a name carved in stone and wood, embedded in the mountains of Tran, rooted in one family, and in the future we continue to build – with responsibility, with hands, and with heart.
