          <strong>ERMA â€“ FAMILY Ltd.</strong> is not just a construction company. It is a <strong>living legacy</strong>, embedded in concrete and preserved through honest craftsmanship.
        </p>
        <p>
          It all began in <strong>1994</strong> with <strong>Tsvetanka Stoilova Yoveva</strong> â€“ founder, visionary, and mother. Inspired by her father <strong>Stoil Trendafilov</strong>, she founded ERMA, weaving in the spirit of generations of craftsmen.

        <p>
          Tsvetanka comes from the <strong>Tran region</strong> â€“ a raw and majestic area known as <strong>the source of some of Bulgaria's best formwork masters and builders</strong>. A place where the stone speaks and craftsmanship is inherited by birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her father, <strong>Stoil Trendafilov â€ </strong>, not only passed down the craftâ€™s values, but also left a mark in national history as <strong>head of the construction of the National Palace of Culture (NDK)</strong> in Sofia.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-800">ðŸ›  The Dupnitsa Spirit â€“ Resilient and Visionary</h2>
        <p>
          Tsvetankaâ€™s husband, <strong>Georgi Yovev â€ </strong>, was from the <strong>Dupnitsa region</strong>. He founded "GECEBOMI" Ltd. â€“ one of the leading companies in Eastern Bulgaria, built on vision, integrity, and respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that same tradition was <strong>Alexander Alexandrov â€ </strong> â€“ a long-time technical team leader from Dupnitsa, inspector for European projects, and key contributor to <strong>Sofia Airport Terminal 2</strong> and many infrastructure projects. His son, <strong>Andrey Alexandrov</strong>, now leads ERMAâ€™s structural division with the same precision and responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, their sons â€“ <strong>Boyan Georgiev Yovev</strong> (investor and partner via "H5M GROUP" and "HIKS 5 GROUP") and <strong>Andrey Alexandrov</strong> â€“ continue their legacy.
